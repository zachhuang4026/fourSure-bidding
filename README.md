[Instruction]
- Please navigate to the submodule and clone that repo to your local, docker or VM.
- I only allow commit permission to the person in charge of that submodule, others can't modify the code under the submodules just for managment purpose.
- For example, Zach is in charge of developing `itemService`, Zach only need to clone the `itemService` repo to his local. It only allows Zach to modify code under `itemService`. But all other team memeber can read the code to sync up.
